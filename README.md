# Conway's Game of Life

### Install
Implementation of Conway's game of life using Python and Kivy. To install using python 3.7, simply clone the repository, create a virtualenv, and run
```
python -m pip install requirements.txt
```

### Use
Pretty simple to use, just click the big field on the right to create cells. Then, use the speed [smaller is faster] and game length [# of rounds] settings to configure the game.

Then use the run/pause/reset buttons to control the simulation.
